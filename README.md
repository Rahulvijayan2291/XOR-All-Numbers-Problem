# XOR All Numbers Problem 🔢  

Efficient solution to the **XOR All Numbers** problem using **bitwise operations** in Java. This repository contains a well-explained approach to solve the problem step-by-step without constructing unnecessary arrays, making it optimized for both **time** and **space** complexity.  

---

## 🚀 Problem Statement  
Given two arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, calculate the XOR of all pairings between their elements. Instead of building the entire pairing array, leverage **bit manipulation** and logical reasoning to achieve an efficient solution.  

### **Example**  
```plaintext
Input: nums1 = [2, 1, 3], nums2 = [10, 2, 5, 0]  
Output: 13
```
